Visitor pattern helps us to add new functionalities/operations to a class without modifying its structure.
It does so by separating all the operation from the object on which it operates.

How to achieve this.
Create two interface.
One for element and another for operations.
Implement multiple elements concrete class by implementing the element interface.
Similarly, implement operations concrete class by implementing the operation interface.

The operations concrete classes will have function overloading of methods based on element concrete class implementations.

It uses "Double Dispatch" operation to perform action.
First is based on concrete element class then calling concrete operation class.
