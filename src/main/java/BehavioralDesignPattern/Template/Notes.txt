Template Pattern is useful in case we want to execute a set of functions in some order and want to enforce the same
to any classes that extends it.
We can create an abstract class, add few methods in it and then create a final method that is calling those abstract
methods in some order. Now any class that extends the abstract class will have to call the final declared method.
