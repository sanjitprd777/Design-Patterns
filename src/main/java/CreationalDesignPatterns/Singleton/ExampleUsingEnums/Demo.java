/*
An enum type is a special type of class.
Your enum will actually be compiled to something like

public final class Singleton {
    public final static Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    private Singleton(){}
}

When your code first accesses INSTANCE, the class Singleton will be loaded and initialized by the JVM.
This process initializes the static field above once (lazily).
