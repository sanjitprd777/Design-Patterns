        Bad code to place here. Better move them to Factory:

            case "Square" -> new Square();
            default -> null;

        When you see code like this, you know that when it comes time for changes or extensions,
        you'll have to reopen this code and examine what needs to be added (or deleted).
        Often this kind of code ends up in several parts of the application,
        making maintenance and updates more difficult and error-prone.
